Typically, an IP address is seen in the form x.x.x.x, four octects that are hexadecimal, going to 255.  
But, an IP address can be interpreted in multiple ways...
I did all of these on the Chrome Browser, but Firefox should also work:

## Decimal
<b> google.com </b>
[http://1249713252]: http://1249713252


## Hexadecimal 
google.com
[http://74.125.28.113] http://74.125.28.113


## Octal

[http://0112.0175.0034.0213] http://0112.0175.0034.0213
```google.com
http://0112.0175.0034.0213
```

But, it doesn't stop here! They can be mixed and matched.
# Mixed
octal.octal.hex.hex
```google.com
http://0112.0175.28.101
```
## Why this is cool

Just something different! Could be used to spoof IP addresses and trick browsers.
