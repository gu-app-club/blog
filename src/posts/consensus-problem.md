The consensus problem in parallel computing is the problem of getting several processes to decide on the same answer.

In order for it to be “solved” they must:
* Decide on a value if they have not crashed (Termination).
* Agree on the same value (Agreement).
* Have agreed on the same value because of some process (Validity).
