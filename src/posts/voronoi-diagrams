Voronoi Diagrams split an area up with polygons that each have a generating point. Each subsequent point in the polygon is closer to the generating point than any other.

Voronoi diagrams and [Delaunay triangulations](<http://bits.gumad.club/delaunay-triangulations/>)  are [related to each other](<https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Spring16/11.pdf>), but aren't the same as shown by these comparison images: ![Voronoi diagram example](http://www.preschern.org/detri/Vor2Dinc.png)
This is an example of a Voronoi diagram, [source](<http://www.preschern.org/detri/DeTri_en.html>)

![Delaunay triangulation example](http://www.preschern.org/detri/DeTri2Dinc.png)
This is an example of a Delaunay triangulation, [source](<http://www.preschern.org/detri/DeTri_en.html>).

As you can see, both of the previous images are from the same original image, but each are unique due to the choice of using Vonoroi diagrams vs Delaunay triangulations.
